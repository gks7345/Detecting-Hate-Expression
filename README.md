# Detecing-Hate-Expression
Now one of important social isuses in korea is hate expression about a specific sites.

Then this project was generated custom model for dtecting hand gestures of hate expression using YOLO-v8.

YOLO is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection algorithm. 

We used the Google Colab Network to generate models at high speed, because Google Colab Network can use GPU

Using this custom model can detect hate expression and shows result of drawing a bounding box.

The dataset consists of train data, valid data, test data.

Valid data consists of 10% of the total data randomly, while the train data consists of the remaining 90%.

The test data consists of 10% of the train data at random.
